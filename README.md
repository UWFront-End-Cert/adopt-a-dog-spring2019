# adopt-a-dog-spring2019 | Course Project

This project is a requirement of the second course of the UW Front End Web Development Certificate program.  It is built using mainly **HTM5L**, **CSS3**, and **JS**. Minimal use of **JQuery** was included. 

## Project Purpose
This project was a means to practice front end development by creating a faux site that is relatable. With visual guidance from the mockup, the **HTML** and **CSS** was produced. 
From there, the subjects that were introduced were **JS**, **JQuery**, and **RWD**. Button functionality, hover effects and the ability to modify content to work on most mobile 
devices were executed in this project. In addition to course requirements, **Gulp** and **SCSS** were also practiced. 

## Site Purpose
Adoptadog is a site for users to browse and adopt dog (or a few) more easily! Descriptions and price of each dog are readily available making the process of finding the right pup faster and more efficient. 
Going into a shelter can tug on the heartstrings which can hinder the judgement of the person adopting- potentially resulting in the adoption of a dog that just doesn't jive well and then being retuned.
It also serves those who may not have the time to make multiple trips to the shelter. Being able to find the right fur-friend is justa s important for them as it is for the site user!
