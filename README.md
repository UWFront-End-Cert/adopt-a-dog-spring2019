*Helpful information for users of the Adopt-A-Dog Website*

## Site Purpose

The purpose of Adopt-A-Dog is to find loving forever homes for our wonderful dogs.

In this digital age, it is important to have an online presence to help us fulfill our mission and reach interested parties.

Users are able to see available dogs, information on each dog, contact info, helpful info for being a responsible dog owner, and the ability to adopt online.

## User Personas

Users of this site will typically have a moderate skill level with online activity, since they are choosing to do their shopping online rather than visiting our shelter at our physical location.

Users will use a variety of ways to access the site. As such, it is important that our site is consistent and responsive across web browsers, operating systems, and device sizes.

The goal of our site is to also be accessible to those with visual impairments. Consideration has been given to access of the site by screen-readers.
