*Seattle's premiere dog adoption agency*

## Site Description

The Adopt A Dog program is well-known for pairing people with the right dog. With over 15 years in the dog connection business, Adopt A Dog is responsible for hundreds of dog/human pairings each year. In the last few years, Adopt A Dog has offered a robust website allowing people to learn about and request the dog of their choice. This site has allowed Adopt A Dog to connect people who may be otherwise unable to travel in person with their ideal companion.

The website is easy to use and includes:
* Color photos of potential companions
* Descriptions of each dog (likes, dislikes, whether they are good with children, etc.)
* The adoption cost of each dog
* A blog with useful about having a dog such as articles about how to travel with dogs, teaching dog tricks, and more
* A form to request dogs and pickup location

The site offers information on breed (when clicking the photo of the dog), and keeps a running total of the cart for selected dogs. The Checkout form can also be used as a way to request contact from someone at Adopt A Dog. Periodic articles about caring for a dog or other helpful tips will be posted in the blog. Professional trainers are consulted for any articles about dog obedience and training. In general, the site is fast becoming as valuable as a visit to one of the locations.

Functionality on the site includes:
* Once you hover over a dog image, it will change so you know if you've viewed the information
* Click the dog images to see the name, breed, and cost of the dogs
* Click the Adopt button to keep a running total of your selected dogs
* The cart in the header tallies the dog adoption costs
* Open the Checkout form to request your dogs, once successfully submitted you will receive a confirmation message
