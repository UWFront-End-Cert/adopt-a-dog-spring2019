Studies showed that a high percentage of users of this website were college students or of college age (early to mid twenties), using Chrome and tablets or mobile devices as their
primary technology. In this respect responsiveness to a variety of screen sizes is very important and played a big part in the development of this website. The site was often visited multiple
times by the same users before purchases were made. College students were less likely to contact with questions prior to purchasing, implying that the layout of the site seems very successful in regards
to maintaining the attention of young professionals who have little time for navigating difficult, high-maintenance and information-heavy websites.

College Students & Technology Usage
https://library.educause.edu/resources/2019/5/ecar-study-of-community-college-students-and-information-technology
Of my findings I found this to be the most recent and relatable study that I could find regarded my user group (college students) and their relationship with information technology.
This seems especially relevant in the respect of my particular user being a college student and using AdoptADog as a means to an end; an information source if you will. This study
says that community college students (women in particular) are very highly likely to use online means to achieve their goals.


SITE TESTED ON:
Chrome: everything looks accurate to the coding! The site performed as expected.
Firefox: everything looks accurate to the coding! The site performed as expected.
Opera: everything looks accurate to the coding! The site performed as expected.
Edge: everything looks accurate to the coding! The site performed as expected.
Mobile: everything looks pretty good except for the "See More Dogs" and "Submit Form" button text got squished (see below)
Mac: as far as I can tell everything looks pretty normal! I used browsershots.org to test how my site would look on a Mac and they provided me several different snapshots on various browsers
like Firefox and Chrome (even though I already tested those browsers live on my own desktop). The layout of the dog profiles seemed a little out of place though, but not enough to detract
from the overall appearance of the site.

CHANGES MADE:
Had to make adjustments to some of the buttons and the form to make them more responsive to different screen sizes, as the "submit form" button text
overlapped quite a bit upon shrinking to mobile. While it still overlaps it's much better than it was before, and is now readable. This issue occurred on all browsers and operating systems tested.
