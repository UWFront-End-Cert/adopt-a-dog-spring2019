Testing

When testing my site I thought a lot about the personas I created and what types of screens and browsers my users would be viewing my site on. I knew I would need to test on all the major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE) and on different screens (iPad, Apple computer, PC Computer, iPhone, Galaxy).I knew that in order for my website to be successful that the content would need to be able to fit all of my devices and adapt to the shape and size of the screen.

When building my site throughout this class we used the technique of graceful degradation - where we designed the site for a website and took away some of the features for the mobile sites. This technique worked because when I tested my site on the normal web browser on a laptop versus testing on a mobile phone, my site adapted for the screen size and showed limited content on the mobile version.

I spent time dragging the size of the window on my site to make sure it was responsive to fit whatever size window I ended up creating. I utilized the dev tools to make sure all my elements were showing up how I had written them in my code.
