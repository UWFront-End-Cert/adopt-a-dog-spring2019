  Persons looking for companionship and to add to a family. Could range from a newly-wed couple looking to expand their 
  family before kids, a recent widower, A parent surprising their children. Majority of users are more tech focused and have     used laoptops and smartphones regularly and stick to the newest versions of browsers (Google and Safari primarily).
  
TESTING
  To test I navigated to the site on each device/browser and clicked each link on each page to ensure proper nav, 
  filled out the form twice to test for the "submit" alert and input validation, and checked for responsiveness by 
  tilting the mobile device, adjusting page size and using inspector.  

RESULTS

  Mobile
    Apple & Android: Site responds on both very well. Blog previews are hidden when using mobile, as expected.
                     The hover effect from desktop site changes the button color only after buttonis clicked. 
                     This may confuse users if they believe button is still selected after. 
  
  Browser
   
    Firefox v67.0 - Site loads nicely and respinds well. Browser asks if user would like to prevent alerts after 
                   a couple clicks on clickable content (dog pictures and the adopt buttons). This could hinder user experience
                   as user would no longer get confirmation that dog is in cart etc. Also, the "Zip Code" label/input is 
                   mis-styled due to its difference in size I believe.
   
    Safari v12.1.1 - Everything works well in Safari. Responsiveness is smooth, alerts are appropriate, JS works. On the form,
                     the Zip Code displays arrows allowing for increments of 1. Not ideal as this number should only be typed in.
    
    Chrome v74.0.3729.169 - This site was made primarily on and for the Google Browser thus things work as expected.
    
    
  Computer
    PC - N/A Was unable to test on a PC.
    Mac - Works great, from CLI to browser!
