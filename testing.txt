User Audience:

Name: Peter S.
Middle/older aged man: 48
Profession: Tech Support Manager
Tech Skills: Minimal- Uses phone to text and google things. Uses computer to google, watch videos, and submit/approve timesheets.
Hobbies include: Going to Vegas at random times, watching soccer, playing with his son, attending work events.
Reason to adopt:
Peter promised his son a dog. He had discussions/arguments with his wife over the course of 6 months as to whether or not it would be a smart choice.
They knew they wouldn't have time for a puppy along with raising their son and having jobs. They compromised on a younger but mature dog that has already
gone through the puppy stage would be the best fit for the family.
