Purpose: The ADOPTADOG website is a website that is meant for users to view dogs
  that can be adopted and read blog posts that can help current or future dog
  owners care and train their dog(s). Users are able to select dogs for adoption
  and learn a little bit of information about the dog.

User: The user would be a young adult who is looking for a companion for if they
 live alone and have the capability of owning a dog in their home or apartment.
 As a young adult the highest level of education would be a bachelors or masters
 degree. The user would have 5-10 years of work experience and would have to have
 a work schedule that would allow them to spend time with and care for their dog.
 They will come to the site because they feel more comfortable browsing for dogs
 online then in person. The user would be able to access the site from their desktop/
 laptops and their mobile devices and they would be able to access the site in
 their free time. The user primarily uses their phone since they carry it with them
 almost everywhere. The user uses social media applications and visits shopping
 websites on a regular basis.

Motivation: The user would need to be motivated to have a companion and accept
  responsibilities of being a dog owner. They are looking for a companion who will
  give them attention. The user will either be looking to adopt a new pet or
  look into the blog for articles on training and taking care of a dog. The needs
  of the person would be to learn more about selecting the right dog and the needs
  of the dog.

Testing: I have tested the site on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I also used the
  "toggle device toolbar" to emulate the site responsiveness on other devices. I
  had to go back into the css file and change the font sizes from pixels to em 
  so the text would resize depending on the device. I also tested the site on my
  Samsung S9 Android phone and had a friend test the site on their iPhone X and the
  site was able to resize to fit the screen.
