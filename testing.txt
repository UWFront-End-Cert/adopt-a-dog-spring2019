Testing -
To test site functionality for these users I ensured the site functioned properly on multiple browsers – chrome, firefox, safari, and edge. I noticed several styling differences on the checkout page within the input fields, specifically select. I have been primarily opening my page in chrome so I did not see this. 

In addition to multiple browsers, I accessed the site via a macbook running chrome and safari. This is where I came across some dramatic differences on the select tag on the checkout page. Using –webkit to address and fix.
Lastly, I pulled up the site from both an android and apple iPhone (Pixel 2XL & iPhone X) using the default browsers (chrome & safari). I noticed a difference on the actual iPhone that didn’t appear on the iPhone X chrome dev tool emulator. On the iPhone the ‘Total Adoption Cost’ didn’t fit on one line, the text wrapped onto a new line and was on top of the text on the previous line. It was all on one line in the emulator.

This testing has instilled confidence that the site will work for my user personas, but I also lost confidence in the chrome dev emulators. It is always best to have access to the actual device, not just the emulator.
