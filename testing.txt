The adopt-a-dog website has been created to cater to the needs of both the adopter as well as the adopting agency, being a great matchmaker in essence.

* Users can browse the dogs that are available for adoption.
* Users can read short blogs that give useful tips on bringing a new dog into the household and training.
* Users can click through to add the dog of their choice and complete the transaction on the site.
* Agencies get the immediate compltion of the transaction through the site and can focus on assuring a great onboarding with the new owner.        
* Agencies are welcome to submit blog stories for posting on the website @ info@adopt-a-blog.com.           

The site has been tested on the following OS/Brower Configurations:

* Windows 10 - Chrome
* Windows 10 - Edge
* Windows 10 - Edge Next
* Android - Chrome

Generally the site renders consistently accross the configurations tested. For smaller screen sizes, the checkout form is not as user freindly as it should be.
