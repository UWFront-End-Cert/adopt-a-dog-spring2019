# Adoptadog

Adoptadog is a website for a premier dog adoption agency. Visitors can find information about available dogs and/or purchase dogs for adoption.

## User Persona

Most site visitors will be between ages 20-35 and likely accessing the site via a smartphone such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy.
Due to site content, age, demographics, and technical expertise may vary. Therefore, the site is built to function on all browsers including Internet Explorer.
The site is also responsive to accommodate visitors on phones, tablets, or laptops/computer. The intention was to make the content easy to read and interact with regardless of how the site is accessed.

## Responsive Design

Note: mobile and tablet design vary slightly from the desktop design to ensure a positive user experience. The desktop version of the site includes a sidebar for blog previews. This is also available on tablets. For smaller screens such as mobile, the sidebar is hidden and content is stacked.

## Testing

All site changes should be tested prior to releasing updates to the public site. It is recommended to maintain a simple design to ensure widespread support.

The site should be tested with the following browsers: Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer
The site should be tested with the following devices: iPads, Surfaces, Android phones, iPhones (all versions within the past 3 years)

Notes on Testing:
- Width of sidebar had to be minimized to ensure it appeared correctly on tablet; a callout for future updates is to ensure this ratio stays interact
- Media queries applied to customize and simplify design for mobile (homepage does not use grid for mobile)
