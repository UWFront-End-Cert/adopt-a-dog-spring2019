I wanted to design this site to be usable across a variety of browsers and devices. To do this I tried to come up with an arbitrary persona that describes someone who would require multiple use cases.

To test the site I rendered it on Chrome, Edge, and Internet Explorer and on a tablet, phone, and computer (with multiple screen sizes).

I wanted to add a function to the site that would show the location of the center and do something to show directions in real time based on the user's location but I wasn't able to put the time in to figure that out, so I'll have to work on it at a later date.
