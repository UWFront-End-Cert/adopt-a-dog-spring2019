      <h2>Traveling with your Dog</h2>
      <p>You gotta think like a tree. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. And maybe a little bush lives there. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. See there how easy that is.</p>
      <p>Have fun with it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>
