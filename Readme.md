Welcome to AdoptADog! This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery to bring users a straightforward experience for the usually intense issue of adopting a dog.

This site has been tested on main browsers and operating systems. It is responsive to multiple screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile, though it is primarily built for
desktop usage.

The priority of this site is to make the process of adopting a dog just as simple as it should be. While our blog provides a wealth of good information and dog-husbandry,
the actual process of looking for a dog is simple enough - spotlighting the name, price, a brief personality description and of course a good portrait photograph.  Our checkout page
was built for speed and simplicity, requiring only the essentials for someone to adopt a dog.
